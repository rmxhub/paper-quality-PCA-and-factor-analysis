Multi-variate selection:

Here the dataset consists of paper quality and pulp fiber characteristics, by applying Principle component analysis, and facor analysis, and conical analysis,  we can draw a formula for the paper quality and pulp fiber characteristics.

Index(fiber characteristics) = 0.422* AFL + 0.393* LFF +0.132* ZST -0.09*
FFF and Index(paper properties)= 0.784*BL + 0.112*BS +0.092*SF + 0.014*EM.
